                <p>The young Spaniard Jose Antonio Rueda confirmed his status as the ruler of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. After being superior in Race 1, he again appeared dominant in the second race.
                </p><br>
                <p>Rueda closed Race 2 JuniorGP Catalunya with a distance of about 8 seconds over his teammate, Syafruddin Azman. Meanwhile, the third podium was claimed by Aspar Junior Team rider Filippo Farioli.
                </p><br>
                <p>This composition is exactly the same as Race 1, where Rueda won, Azman was runner-up and Farioli finished P3. Meanwhile, Indonesian rider Fadillah Arbi Aditama failed to finish the race due to a crash .  
                </p><br>
                <p>Jose Antonio Rueda, who started from pole , had lost his position at Turn 1 after being overtaken by Tatchakorn Buasri (Honda Racing Thailand). However, he quickly responded and was able to take over again at T2.
                </p><br>
                <p>Behind the three racers must end the race faster. Edward O'Shea (British Talent Team), Danial Shahril (Asia Talent Team) and Collin Veijer (AGR Team) were involved in an accident at Turn 5 in Catalunya.
                </p><br>
                <p>Returning to the front row, Rueda opened a 1-second lead over Azman on the second lap. Meanwhile, David Salvador (Laglisse Academy-Husqvarna) nudged David Alonso (Aspar) in the straight start/finish sector.  
                </p><br>
                <p>Salvador then came into contact again at Turn 1, this time with Buasri. Unfortunately for the Thai rider , the incident made it wide into the gravel . Even though at that time, he was in the competition for the podium zone.  
                </p><br>
                <p>Fadillah Arbi Aditama had shot to number 10, even reaching P9 on the third lap. However, in the next lap, he slumped to 14th position. Unfortunately, with seven laps remaining in Race 2, Arbi fell. This is the first time he DNF.
                </p><br>
                <p>Previously, in Race 1 JuniorGP Catalunya, the 16-year-old teenager finished the race in P28. This also means that the Astra Honda Racing Team rider failed to repeat his achievements in the round in Valencia.
                </p><br>
                <p>At that time, in Race 2 JuniorGP Valencia, Fadillah Arbi managed to score his first point. However, he has plenty of opportunities to do so because there are still many races to go this season.
                </p><br>
                <p>Entering the 10th lap, Rueda further widened the advantage. Meanwhile, his team mate, Angel Piqueras had to fight closely with Salvador and Azman, to maintain his position in second place.  
                </p><br>
                <p>But it was David Almansa who was able to take over P2 early in the second half of the race. He was followed by Salvador. On the other hand, Mattia Volpi (AGR Team-KTM) crashed . This means he failed to finish in two races in Catalunya.
                </p><br>
                <img width="100%" src="img/picture-2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Alex Gourdon of the Leopard Impala Junior Team-Honda had to end the race after 10 laps due to a technical problem with his bike. Meanwhile, Daniel Munoz (BOE SKX-KTM) crashed on lap 12.
                </p><br>
                <p>Entering the last 4 laps, Rueda has led more than 10 seconds. While behind him, a fierce duel is still going on between the seven drivers, including Almansa, Salvador, Piqueras and Azman.
                </p><br>
                <p>Almansa began to loose and lost the second position. He briefly dropped to P6, but moved up to P4 after Farioli touched Piqueras. Luckily no one crashed in the incident.
                </p><br>
                <p>Azman managed to make a gap with two laps remaining. In the finals, Rueda remained comfortable with an 8-second advantage. Farioli started to close in on P2, with Piqueras also continuing to press him for P3.
                </p><br>
                <p>In the end, Azman was able to secure the runner-up position, followed by Farioli. While Piqueras had to settle for occupying P4. He again failed to reach the podium after in Race 1 also finished fourth.
                </p><br>
                <p>With two victories in Catalunya, Jose Antonio Rueda is increasingly firmly at the top of the 2022 JuniorGP standings. With a perfect achievement, he has now collected a total of 108 points, 39 points ahead of David Salvador.
                </p>
