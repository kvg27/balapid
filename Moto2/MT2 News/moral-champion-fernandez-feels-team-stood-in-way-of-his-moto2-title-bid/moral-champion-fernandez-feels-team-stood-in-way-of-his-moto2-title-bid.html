                <p>Fernandez stunned in his rookie Moto2 season this year, winning eight races – surpassing Marc Marquez's haul of seven from his debut Moto2 campaign in 2011 – and narrowly missed out on the championship by four points to Ajo teammate Remy Gardner, who won five times.
                </p><br>
                <p>Both riders will step up to MotoGP in 2022 with Tech3 KTM, with the pair on track on Thursday and Friday at the two-day Jerez test.
                </p><br>
                <p>In an interview, Fernandez says, "nobody knew how to guide us" and feels he is more deserving of the championship.
                </p><br>
                <p>"It is clear that I have not been the champion, but morally I have in my head that I have achieved something that costs a lot," the Spaniard said.
                </p><br>
                <p>"The problem we had is that my whole team, and when I say my team I mean my mechanics, who I was very lucky to find such a special group, were inexperienced and nobody knew how to guide us.
                </p><br>
                <p>"And that's why today we don't have the championship crown, but morally it has been proved by the result that I am the strongest rider, with more wins, poles, fastest laps...
                </p><br>
                <p>"Remy is the champion, he has scored more points, but really with the speed we had and being a fish that swims against the current, I honestly feel morally champion.
                </p><br>
                <p>"What we have done being all new and getting to know each other this year, it's impressive."
                </p><br>
                <img width="100%" src="img/picture 2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>When pressed on what he meant about not being guided properly, Fernandez added: "It is very easy to answer, I have lacked a hand to guide us, a hand to tell us, like little children before they trip over a stone, to be careful.
                </p><br>
                <p>"A figure that would guide us and open the way for us, a figure that would want to help us to win, not a figure that would put stones and obstacles in our way so that we wouldn't succeed. That was the key.
                </p><br>
                <p>"It's very nice to talk about being a champion when you've been in a category for six years, saying that I've been smarter.
                </p><br>
                <p>"No, you haven't been smarter, you've been the one who has had the fewest stones put in your way."
                </p><br>
                <p>Asked if those "stones" were placed in his way by the team, he said: "Yes. Everyone can understand it as they like, but we know it.
                </p><br>
                <p>"It has cost us sweat and tears. In the middle of the year we talked and all of them [my mechanics] were having a hard time, we were all looking forward to the end of the season.
                </p><br>
                <p>"In the end everyone understands what they want and I'm not going to go into the details of what happened."
                </p>
