                <p>Mario's weekend has been tough since the first free practice. The challenge is increasing after the qualifying results are far from encouraging, caused by an accident by another racer.
                </p><br>
                <p>While preparing to perform a time attack , Xavier Artigas crashes in front of him. Unable to escape, Mario fell too. Due to this, #64 timed out and was unable to fix the clock.
                </p><br>
                <p>Starting the race from the very back of the grid is definitely difficult. Sure enough. Even though he had poked at number 22, Mario was suddenly in the last position. It was soon followed by lap information which said the driver retired .
                </p><br>
                <p>However, the young man from Magetan, East Java then continued the race. Just a few laps, Mario entered the pits again. As if nothing seemed to matter, he returned to the running of the German Moto3 race.
                </p><br>
                <p>Despite being so far behind, Mario refuses to give up. Even when he was given a long lap penalty for violating the track limit . After struggling hard, Super Mario was finally able to finish the race .
                </p><br>
                <img width="100%" src="img/picture-2.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>It was later revealed that the technical problem he had experienced was due to Mario's high side in the early laps. Damage to the motor forced him into the pits for repairs. It cost him a lot of time.
                </p><br>
                <p>“Today was the hottest day of the weekend for a 27 lap race. Both drivers started the race quite well. But on lap 4, Mario had a high side , damaging the fairing ," said Team Manager Honda Team Asia, Hiroshi Aoyama.
                </p><br>
                <p>“He had to go into the pits to fix the bike and rejoin. Lost time and all chances for a good result."
                </p><br>
                <p>Despite finishing P23, Aoyama still praised Mario's unyielding spirit. The man from Japan appreciated the attitude of his drivers, while stressing that his team will continue to work for the Assen lap.
                </p><br>
                <p>Meanwhile, Mario admits that the Sachsenring has made it difficult for him from the start. Although disappointed with the results of his race in Moto3 Germany, the Astra Honda Racing Team (AHRT) fostered racer chose to focus on the next series.
                </p><br>
                <p>“It was a difficult weekend for us. We've been fighting since Friday. In the race, I got a lot of positions after starting from P29," said Mario.
                </p><br>
                <p>“But I almost fell because of the high side . The motor is also damaged and the airbag inflates. I (had to) go into the pits to fix the bike and get back racing.
                </p><br>
                <p>"It's a shame, but we will race again, this time in Assen. A new option for a good result before the summer break.”
                </p>
