                    Government agencies;
                    Search engines;
                    News organizations;
                    Online directory distributors may link to our Website in the same manner as they hyperlink to the
                    Websites of other listed businesses; and
                    System-wide Accredited Businesses except soliciting non-profit organizations, charity shopping
                    malls, and charity fundraising groups which may not hyperlink to our Web site.
                    These organizations may link to our home page, to publications, or to other Website information so
                    long as the link: (a) is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship,
                    endorsement, or approval of the linking party and its products and/or services; and (c) fits within
                    the context of the linking party's site.</p>
                <br>

                <p>We may consider and approve other link requests from the following types of organizations:

                    We will approve link requests from these organizations if we decide that: (a) the link would not
                    make us look unfavorably to ourselves or to our accredited businesses; (b) the organization does not
                    have any negative records with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility of the hyperlink
                    compensates the absence of PT.Balap Indonesia; and (d) the link is in the context of general
                    resource information.</p>
                <br>
                <p>These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a) is not in any way deceptive;
                    (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement, or approval of the linking party and its
                    products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party's site.</p>
                <br>
